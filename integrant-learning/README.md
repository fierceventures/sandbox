# integrant-learning

Learning how to use [Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant) with some very simple example. Will be
looking into how to use different config files - `dev.edn` vs `prod.edn` - for different environments to simulate
dependency injection.

## Usage

### Run (default)
```bash
lein run
```

### Run (in env)
```bash
export env=prod
lein run
```
